# RESTpractice
Following a freeCodeCamp tutorial about building a simple Node/Express application with MongoDB. Going to make this as unique as possible, while still following the tut, and then make a follow up using what I learned to create one from scratch. This is the follow-along side of the project to get my bearings. Video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yqu8YF29cU

***PROJECT WILL BE DEPLOYED TO TURBO360 AND mLab. Will update with links in the future.
